     WWW stands for the World Wide Web, and it refers to a system of interconnected documents and resources that are accessed via the internet. It is often abbreviated as "the web." The WWW was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and became publicly accessible in 1991.

    <P>  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. HTML is the building block of web pages and is used to structure content, such as text, images, links, forms, and other elements, on the internet.     </P>
    <P>   CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is used to control the layout, appearance, and design of web pages. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can create more flexible and consistent designs across a website.     </P>
